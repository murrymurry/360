## Agreed upon ground rules:

- Team members should have the tasks they were assigned for that Sprint done in full by each Sprint Planning Meeting. If for any reason the tasks won't be done in time or the team member needs help, they should reach out to another team member or the Group Coordinator before the Sprint Planning Meeting.
- A team member missing 2 consecutive Sprint Planning Days without a Good Excuse (family, personal emergencies) will be considered for termination.

## Team Roles and Responsibilties:

**__Full Stack Developer & Designer__** (~10 hours/week): Everyone is this. Communicate any issues to the Team Coordinator, for example, if a feature is taking longer than you anticipated to implement, or if there is some fundamental problem with the task as it was assigned.

In the beginning, we will be more design oriented, whereas at the end of the project we will be more implementation and programming oriented, so all team members need to be designers and full stack developers.

**__Project Manager__** (additional 5 hours/week): The project manager’s role is setting out the long-term goals of the project, and ensuring the project’s requirements are met and the project contains no critical bugs. The primary tool for achieving this is by communicating which features are most important for the week to the Team Coordinator.

This requires being aware of everyone’s tasks, and taking into account how long each task is going to take, and setting aside time each week before the Sprint Planning Day with the Team Coordinator to plan the next Sprint.

**__Team Coordinator__** (additional 5 hours/week): The project’s needs may change from week to week, so the Team Coordinator’s role is to compiling a list of tasks based on the needs of the project before the Sprint Planning Meeting. The project manager should also participate in helping to determine the tasks based on the road map of the project. During the Sprint Planning Day we can collectively decide how tasks will be divided based on everyone’s preference as well as the needs of the project.

## Communication Plan:

- Check Discord throughout the week for important information or to ask for help.
- Attend Sprint Planning Meetings
